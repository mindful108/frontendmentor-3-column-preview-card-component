## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a nice and simple challenge to practice the basics and to continue to develop my workflow and starter code, especially for posting to Frontend Mentor, Github and now deploying with Vercel.

I also enjoy adding additional responsive breakpoints for smaller screens.

### Continued development

I plan to do more Frontend Mentor projects to continue developing my speed and workflow using my own custom snippets and starter templates. I will also start to use Tailwind CSS and looking forward to incorporating React for more interactive challenges.
